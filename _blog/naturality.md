Naturalizm

$10^{120}$
 Much has been made about the lack of “naturalness” in the existence of a large number in funda-
mental physics. We do not think this is necessarily good thinking. The heliocentric model proposed
by Aristarchus of Samos in antiquity was discarded because it required that the distance to the stars
was a number “too large to be realistic”, otherwise the Earth movement would have determined a
stellar parallax, which was not observed. This “naturalness” argument is in Ptolemy, and is wrong.
Similar “naturalness” arguments were used until the late XIX century against the atomic hypoth-
esis, because the Avogadro number was “too large” to be realistic. When we learn more about the
universe, we see farther away, and we learn that what looks “natural” to us may just be so because
of our limited experience.
